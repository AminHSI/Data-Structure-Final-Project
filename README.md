# Sorting Algorithms in C++

This project implements and compares various sorting algorithms in C++. The algorithms included are:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort

Each sorting algorithm is measured for its latency, which is the time it takes to sort a randomly generated list of numbers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you will need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- C++11 or later

### Compiling the Code

To compile the code, use the following command:

```sh
g++ -std=c++11 -o sorting sorting.cpp
